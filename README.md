# Pair-Em
This was my first time creating any type of website or using global storage. 
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase in order to create Pair'Em. 
This site was created with the intent to connect experienced college students with people who have personalized questions.
Going on the internet and searching up questions can be difficult sometimes as too much general information is presented to you.
With Pair'Em, you can have access to free, personalized information within minutes, no appointments or scheduling nessecary.
Currently, this project is just a prototype, and my team and I are looking to implement a real chat feature, a profile to display resumes and other creditals.
I learned a lot in this project, frontend and backend included!
